        This project is an experiment to demonstrate the search quality of
        Upstash Vector using the TMDB movie dataset. We vectorized{" "}
        <b>71,673 TMDB movies</b> into a single Upstash Vector index and
        searched them across multiple dimensions, including title, abstract, and
        cast.
